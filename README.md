# DAND-Investigate-Dataset-Project
This repo contains Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Project entitled "Investigate a Dataset".
In this project, I chose one of Udacity's curated datasets (Medical Appointment No-Shows in Brazil) and investigated it using NumPy and pandas.
I completed the entire data analysis process, starting by posing my research questions, then assessing and cleaning the dataset, followed by visualizing the data, and finishing by sharing my findings.
